    <h3> The Famous Amos Cookie Story</h3>
    <p>Over the years, millions have slaved over the hot stoves trying to recapture the sensational taste created on that glorious day in Lowell, Massachusetts. But not until 1970, when Wally Amos started to bake his secret recipe, has any chocolate chip cookie been so thoroughly authentic and delicious at the same time. </p>
    <p>The face that launched a thousand chips, Wally Amos is the father of the gourmet cookie industry. As inventor of "Famous Amos" cookies, his story is the quintessential American success story. </p>
    <p>The "Famous Amos" cookie tale began when Wally Amos began using his bite-sized cookies as calling cards and thank-you gifts. As Wally made his rounds in his entertainment business, more and more of his friends and clients asked for another bag of Wally Amos Cookies. Finally, with the backing of several Hollywood personalities, Wally launched The Famous Amos Cookies Company in 1975.</p>
    <p>Today we carry on the traditions of our founder-baker. We still use the original recipes and the finest ingredients. Our cookies are bite sized and crunchy; they’re delicious! And Famous.</p>
    <p>So enjoy these “Famous Amos” chocolate chip cookies at your nearest Hot-baked Store!</p>
    <p>Have A Brown Day Always!</p>
